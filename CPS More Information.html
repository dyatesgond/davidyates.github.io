			<b>For his dissertation research, Dr. Roger Firestien, Senior Buffalo State Professor compared creative productivity between CPS-trained groups and other groups <i>not</i> trained in creative problem solving. </b> 
		<ul>

			<li>The study involved 20 five-person groups who had approximately 12 hours of CPS training and 20 five-person groups who were not trained. </li>
			<li>Researchers gave groups a business problem to solve and video recorded them at work. </li>
			<li>As you an see from the first table to the right, groups trained in CPS showed significanty higher levels of participation, criticized ideas less, ad supported team members mmore. </li> 
			<li>They also smiled and laughed more, which is important because additional research has confirmed that positive group dynamics promotes creative problem solving. </li> 
			<li>As the second table indicates, the trained groups outperformed the untrained groups in generating highly-rated ideas.</li></p>
