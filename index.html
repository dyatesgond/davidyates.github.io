	<h1> Hi, my name is David Yates. </h1>
	<p>I am looking forward to adding to my educational technology toolbox in an area I've not done much with in my 47 years in the classroom. 
		
		The only web design software I have used includes user-friendly but amateurish apps and programs like Google Sites, Wix, and Wordpress, so I want to up my game by working with someone who Dr. Schwartz indicates really knows his stuff (no pressure, Matt!).

		I am particularly interested in learning strategies I can pass on to the educators I train for Buffalo State's International Graduate Program for Educators and for Southeastern University. 
		
		I teach master's level ed tech and ed leadership courses and my fellow educators are always looking for ways to engage their students, especially in virtual environments. Students love opportunities to create!
		
		I also teach creativity courses so I want to learn new ways to use the web creatively, not just technically, and am hoping to learn how teachers can add web design projects to the assignment options they give their students.
		
		I do all of my teaching, training, and learning online from an RV, traveling from one beautiful part of the U.S. and Canada to another. 
		
		I will complete our course while camped in the Vermont's Green Mountains, getting my exercise by riding my bike about 25 miles a day up and down the hills that surround my site..</p>
